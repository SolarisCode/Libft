# Libft
This is my own implementation of some of the 
most used and basic funcations in C

Including recreating more than 22 functions from libc standard library and a couple from other libraries in C,
44 functions in total to be used in my future project to get a better understanding of how they fundamentally work.

## The first 22 function:

• isalpha
• isdigit
• isalnum
• isascii
• isprint
• toupper
• tolower
• strchr
• strrchr
• strncmp
• strlen
• memset
• bzero
• memcpy
• memmove
• strlcpy
• strlcat
• memchr
• memcmp
• strnstr
• atoi
• calloc
• strdup
